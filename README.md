FerrisWheel
===========

## Question

Having a ferris wheel with `n` chairs (from `1` to `n`), `p` persons come
to buy tickets. Each rotation costs 1 euro and on each ticket is written
how many times is the person allowed to rotate.

This application should say:

 - How much will earn the host of the ferris wheel?
 - What's the order of the persons that left the wheel?
 - What's the last chair that was emptied?

## Example

```sh
How many chairs? n = 3
How many persons? p = 2
Rotations:
> c(1) = 10
> c(2) = 3
Sum: 13 euro
Order of persons that left the wheel: 2 1
Last chair that was emptied: 1
```
